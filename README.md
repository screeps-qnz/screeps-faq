# screeps-faq
frequently asked screeps related questions

the purpose of this repo is to gather answers to frequently asked screeps related questions, so that maybe the help channel on the screeps slack will be a little bit less repetitive. the questions should be related to the screeps api, the answers should explain docs, or explain how certain things work server side. sort of like the necessary look behind the scenes, rather than a how to do things ingame. 

hopefully someone will find it useful.
